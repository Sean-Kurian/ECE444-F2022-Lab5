# Pros and Cons of TDD: 
 ## Pros
  -Only necessary code is written  
  -Design is modular, maintainable and readable  
  -Code is easy to refactor and prevents regression  
  -Tests are a form of documentation for code  
 ## Cons
 -Doesn't find bugs introduced in code if tests don't cover those edge cases  
 -Writing tests first and then developing is slow  
 -Have to maintain and refactor all tests if requirements change
